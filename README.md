# El-Doctor-Project

## Linux project 3


- Module: **Scripting** 
- Competence: `is able to write a custom script to monitor machines`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `3 day`
- Deadline: `12/04/2024`
- Participants: : `solo`

## The mission

There exist a plethora of amazing monitoring tools out there, some of which go as far as offering a full blown graphical dashboard collecting metrics on your entire system in a single unified interface, isn't it great?! Well, this challenge will have you throw all those pre-made solution out the window to **create your own** monitoring script!

You will have multiple days to make it as **useful** (_collect the data you want or need_) and **fancy** (_interactive interface_, _features_, _..._) as possible, the goal is for you to **be creative** and **make it your own**! As such, we won't give you clear instructions to follow nor specific features to implement. Still, we are no monster so here are some idea to inspire you:

- Make an interactive [curses interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) (_or similar_) for your script.
- Deploy your script on a machine you manage and use something like [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to execute once an hour.
- Collect metrics every hour and store them in an [CSV file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).
- If the state of the machine is critical (_not enough ram_, _..._), notify yourself by mail.
- Send yourself a system report once a week.

In order to validate this challenge, you must have a repository containing your script and its documentation along with your script.

Having seen the basics of monitoring during project nr 2, I went straight to work on my script, which I worked on as and when I needed it and the information I needed to provide.
